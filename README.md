# A React client for Hackernews
I created this Hackernews react client app in order try out connecting it to their Firebase API.

[DEMO HERE](https://arnaskro.github.io/hackernews-react)

# Stack
1. React
2. Redux
3. React Router
4. Semantic-ui
5. Webpack 2

# Pages
Currently the app contains only 2 pages:

| # | Page | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Main page | `"/"` |
| 2 | Story page | `"/story/:id"` |

# Setup
First install the dependencies with `npm install` and to view the application on your `localhost:3000` run this command `npm run dev`. That is it!
